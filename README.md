# US-Arrest_K-means
Using R and the ISLR library, this project conducted an in-depth K-Means clustering analysis on the 'USArrests' dataset. The goal was to reveal patterns and insights in arrest-related data. The process included scaling for uniformity and exploring the impact of different cluster numbers (K) on result interpretability.
